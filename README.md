## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid layout
- Media Queries to support responsiveness.

### What I learned

    - Got better understanding with usage of media queries, css Flexbox and grid layout.

### Continued development

    - Got better at using width and measurement units to support responsiveness, but still think I need more practise at using measurements like rem, vh, etc., to support better responsiveness.
    - Havent got the last part of images and text aligning parallely as shown in design, it would be helpful if I get a better recommendation of how its done.
